# Vite + TailwindCSS (no framework)

`npm start` will...start the `localhost:3000` server.

There is some opinionated/standard stuff included for ESLint and Prettier. These are wired up to do some automatic things in VS Code via [`settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json). For example, as soon as you leave the file it will auto save, format and even fix linting stuff for you. If that's too much, you may want to reconfigure it.

Finally, there are a few [recommended extensions](./.vscode/extensions.json). You'll probably want these.

Hope it helps. Give it a ⭐, will ya? 🤓
